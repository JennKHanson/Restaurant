## Description
Restaurant Reviews is a Udacity project as part of the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree.
A webpage was converted to a mobile-ready, responsive web application that is accessible for screen reader
users. A service worker was added to cache requests, so that previously visited pages are viewable over a slow or unavailable network connection.
